HackerRank Question : https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/what-type-of-triangle/problem?isFullScreen=true

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

    Equilateral: It's a triangle with 

sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with
sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with

    sides of differing lengths.
    Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle

Select case
            when C >= A+B then "Not A Triangle"
            when A=B and B=C then "Equilateral"
            when A=B or A=C or B=C then "Isosceles"
            else "Scalene" End as TriangleOrNot
